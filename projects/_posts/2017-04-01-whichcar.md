The WhichCar project was an interesting one; it was our first react js website, our first production roll-out of node js and our first single-page application.

What is it?
-----------

Normally for a classified car site to find a car you have to choose which make, model, engine size etc. you want. It turns out this is knowledge that a large group of people either don't have or just don't care about when choosing a car. WhichCar makes it easier by instead choosing a car by a set of classifications (family, performance, city etc.) and which aspect appeals to the user more (price, safety or fuel consumption). Although for the people who do care, a more traditional search is available too.
