Those of us with cars in our teenage years might recognize street machine magazine and will probably recall our cars looked nothing like them (at least I had a subwoofer). The Motoring project involved most of the front-end work being outsourced to a third party and then us retrofitting the code to use across 5 other websites, all while being distracted by the big boys toys on display.
