Everybody has heard of Autotrader, its a big name in at least the UK and US. This is the NZ version and it was firmly a brownfield project by the time I was involved.

What is it?
-----------

Autotrader is classified site focused on cars. The codebase used to house more than just autotrader however, it used to house boats, farm gear, trucks and probably some other classified sites that I can't remember. Most of the day to day was removing the code to just the car specific stuff, fixing bugs and of course adding new features.
